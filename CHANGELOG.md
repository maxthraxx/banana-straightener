## [0.1.8] - 2025-01-09

### üñºÔ∏è Image Format Improvements
- **Fixed WebP images in web UI**: All images now display as PNG format in browsers
- **Consistent PNG output**: Images from Gemini API are immediately converted to RGB/PNG format
- **Better browser compatibility**: Right-click ‚Üí Save Image now saves as PNG files instead of WebP
- **Optimized PNG compression**: Removed unnecessary quality parameters from PNG saves (PNG is lossless)

### üîß Technical Changes
- Added `format="png"` parameter to all Gradio Image components
- Enhanced image pipeline to convert WebP to PNG immediately after receiving from Gemini API
- Improved image consistency throughout the entire application flow
- Fixed PyPI trusted publishing configuration to match repository settings

### üöÄ Deployment & Release
- **Fixed automated PyPI publishing**: Resolved "invalid-publisher" errors with trusted publishing
- **Streamlined release workflow**: Renamed workflow from `release.yml` to `publish.yml` 
- **Environment configuration**: Added proper `pypi` environment for secure publishing
- **Reliable CI/CD**: Automated releases now work correctly with GitHub ‚Üí PyPI publishing
