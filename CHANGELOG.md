## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-09

### üöÄ Major Improvements
- **Fixed Repetitive Iteration Problem**: Enhanced prompt engineering to avoid identical iterations
- **Smarter Evaluation System**: Improved evaluator to provide specific, actionable feedback instead of generic responses
- **Iteration-Aware Strategies**: Different approaches for early (1-3), mid (4-6), and late (7+) iterations
- **Alternative Approach Detection**: Automatically switches strategies when stuck in repetitive loops

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Feedback Diversity Check**: Detects when feedback is >80% similar to previous iterations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Builds on previous attempts instead of starting fresh each time
- **Better Debug Logging**: Shows parsed improvements and fallback warnings
- **Multi-line Evaluation Parsing**: Properly handles bullet-point feedback from evaluator

### üé® UI Improvements

- Improved evaluation prompt with specific examples of good vs bad feedback
- Better parsing of multi-line evaluator responses
- Added repetition detection algorithms

### üì¶ Developer Experience
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated PyPI publishing
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with testing across Python 3.10-3.12
- Created comprehensive CHANGELOG for version tracking

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-08
