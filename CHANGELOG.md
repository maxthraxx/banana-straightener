## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-09

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Multi-image conditioning across Library, CLI, and UI:**
  - Python API: `agent.straighten(prompt, input_images=[img1, img2, ...])`
  - CLI: repeat `-i/--image` flag (e.g., `-i style1.png -i style2.jpg`)
  - Web UI: upload multiple files with thumbnails preview
- **Enhanced UI polish**: clearer image uploader, larger drop zone, previews, and guidance that up to 3 images are recommended
- **Better multi-image support**: Seamless handling of multiple input images for style transfer and conditioning

### üîß Internal Changes
- **Unified on `google.genai`**: Removed `google.generativeai` usage for cleaner dependencies
- **Enhanced logging**: Replaced print statements in core with proper `logging`; CLI controls verbosity via `-v/--verbose`
- **Safer UI state handling**: Per-session `gr.State` for better concurrent user support
- **Improved ZIP creation**: Support for multiple input images in session downloads

### üß™ Tooling & Documentation
- **Added `.pre-commit`** hooks with black/flake8/mypy for code quality
- **Improved tests** and documentation for multi-image usage scenarios
- **Enhanced README** with multi-image examples and updated API documentation
